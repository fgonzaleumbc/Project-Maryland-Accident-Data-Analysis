    "- MD_Crash_report files are vehicle crash report data obtained from for https://opendata.maryland.gov. These include four data tables on accident crash reports, driver (person) data, emergency medical services (EMS) data, and vehicle data. All tables have a common ID feature called \"Report Number\". The data includes the following years and quarters:\n",
